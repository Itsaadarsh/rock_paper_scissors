# Real time ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME
Hey guys this is my first project using OpenCV.It is basically a game of rock,paper and scissors against a computer.I first started with collecting images of rock,paper and scissors to train my model and luckly I found a dataset which consist of 2500 images with separtely labeled training and testing folder of rock,paper and scissors then I started with cleaning up my data and preprocessing all the images into a numpy array of pixel values once that was done then I started with training my model :

Once the model was trained it gave me around (97% accuracy) which was really shocking to me.
Then I started with the game file in which I have used OpenCV to read my webcam,draw bounding box to read my hand movements and basically put all my code together and start predicting the real time frames of my hand movement and predict whether its a Rock or a Paper or a Scissor and match it with the computers move and give us the results.
If you guys wanna try it just download the finalmodel.h5 file and run rps.py file on your system.
